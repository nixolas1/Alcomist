Its a site where you have a overview and stats over your alcohol consumption. One register each beverage one consumes and personal information, and you'll get predictions and suggestions on what you should or shouldn't drink.

What multi-media content do you want to include?
Our site will not require a large amount of multimedia. Most of our design will be done in CSS and needs for multi-media content is mostly limited to simple pictures. We will have a simple colorful design with images beeing graphically designed drawings. The pictures we do need we will draw ourselves.

What type of interactions and dynamic features do you want on your site?
