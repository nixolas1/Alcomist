            <p>
            <h4>About the project</h4>
                Our project is a website which aims to give the user a statistical overview of their alcohol consumption over the course of a night.
                The user registers each alcoholic bevarage he or she consumes and some personal attributes (such as height and weight) which affect the blood alcohol level, and in return receives his or her current estimated blood alcohol content (BAC), a prediction of future levels and a suggestion on whether or not to drink more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Potential users and special requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Potential users are smart phone owners who like drinking responsibly. The site will have a responsive design, with simple interaction and an optimal viewing experience for both smart phone users and users of other devices. However, the main focus will be on smart phone users, seeing as most people do not have access to any other web browsing capable devices while they are out drinking. This means that we don't have to be concerned with older browsers. It also means that we have to implement a design that works with different resolutions.
            </p>

            <h4>Interaction and dynamic functions:</h4>
              The layout of the site will change depending on whether you're logged in or not. We plan to have a default page that anyone can use without having to log in. First time users will have the option to sign up after filling out their attributes, so that these attributes can be stored for succeeding uses. Signing up should be a simple process, preferably only demanding a unique user name and an optional password. <br>
              Since most users will be using a smart phone to browse the site, it is essential that the graphical user interface we implement is designed for readability and interaction on small screens with different resolutions. We must take into account that the user only has access to a touch screen and a small keyboard. The keyboard often covers up a significant part of the screen and we will therefore attempt to avoid having too many keyboard interactions. Designs such as drop down menus, thumb-sized buttons, and sliders will be considered in the final design.<br>
              After logging in or entering their personal attributes for the first time, user will have access to the main page. This is where the user will be able to add the alcoholic beverages he or she drinks during the night. This will be done either by clicking on some preset values that we believe will be used most frequently (e.g. Beer 4.7% 0.5L, Wine 12% 175mL, Shot 40% 2cL) or by entering a custom beverage.<br>
              The data entered by the user will then be processed, and the user will see some relevant stats, graphs, warnings, encouraging messages etc. related to his or her alcohol consumption.

            <h4>What we've learned from watching other pages:</h4>
            <p>From watching other webpages we learned that the sitemap and menu has to be relevant to the page, and avoid having too many ads. Since we do not initially seek to profit from this, we may drop ads altogether. It has to be simple usage, also you have to be ablo to navigate easily using just your keyboard. The forms also has to be easy filled.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Multimedia files</h4>
            <p>Our site will not require a large amount of multimedia. Most of our design will be done in CSS and needs for multi-media content is mostly limited to simple pictures. We will have a simple colorful design with images beeing graphically designed drawings. The pictures we do need we will draw ourselves.</p>

            <h3>Bad page</h3>

            <ul class="toc listafterpul listtight">
              <li>Page title: It has some irrelevant titling, as of "R U Pissed? - Online Breathalyzer Test and Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) Level Calculator - Hangover Cures" there is nothing implying Hangover cures being present on the frontpage.</li>
              <li>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.): They got alot of errors, regarding missing alt text on the images</li>
              <li><em>Text:</em>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Headings: Yes they have headings</li>
                      <li>Contrast ratio ("color contrast"): Its alot of colors, because of the "hardcoded" ads on the webpage, but the contrast is acceptable</li>
                      <li>Resize Text: No overlapping text when you're resizing.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                      <li>Keyboard access and visual focus: Bad Keyboard access, when thinking about working with the page using only TAB. Takes some time untill you get to the inputfields. Image links are badly outlined when they are tabbed to
                      </li>
                      <li>Forms, labels, and errors (including  Search fields): They have JS alert when something is submitted wrong, but doesn't say which inputfields that are wrong.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>

                  <ul>
                      <li>Multimedia (video, audio) alternatives: Way to much ads</li>
                      <li>Basic Structure Check: Bad sitestructure. Way to much on the site seems irrelevant except the index.html.</li>
                  </ul>

                    <li>Resize Text: text inside elements resizes properly, but top bar becomes too big on zoom</li>
