                <p>
                Alcomist is a project started by 4 students at the <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/">Norwegian
                University for Science and Technology (NTNU)</a> as an assignment
                in the course <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IT2805/2014">Web Technologies</a>.
                Our assignment was to create a website based on specific criterias,
                and we wanted to make something we would use ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                Being students
                it seemed appropriate our website was in relevance to alcohol consumption.
                There are many sites that let you calculate your blood alcohol level,
                however none of the ones we could find allow for continuous use
                throughout the night - letting the user keep track of their estimated
                blood alcohol content in real-time. We saw this as something we and others
                could have great use for.
                </p>

                <p>
                Giving you an estimate throughout the night lets the user be more aware
                of their alcohol influence. This is in no way an accurate way to base
                decisions on whether it is okay (as in legal) to drive e.g. You can read more about the way we
                calculate blood alcohol content, health risks associated with drinking and how to contact us,
                using the navigation bar at the top of the website.
