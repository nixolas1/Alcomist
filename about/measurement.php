                Calculating blood alcohol content (BAC) is difficult, as each individual 
                responds to alcohol differently. The BAC resulting from alcohol consumption 
                varies with factors such as gender, weight, height, muscle mass and metabolism. 
                The latter is important as it affects your bodyâ€™s ability to eliminate alcohol 
                (reducing your BAC over time).
                </p>

                <p>
                Without conducting a breath test or a blood test, the best we can do is give an 
                estimate based on some generalizations. One of the assumptions made in our 
                calculation is that a person with average metabolism has a reduction of his or her 
                BAC by 0.15 permille per hour. Alcomist uses a formula obtained from the 
                Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The formula takes weight and gender 
                into account, omitting any other factors.
